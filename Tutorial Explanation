Open up your command prompt in an Administrator mode
decide where you want to create the folder, select that directory path and change to that directory on your command prompt,
after that go to step 1

Step 1: Create one project folder.
Create one project folder, in my case VuejsTutorial.

mkdir VuejsTutorial
Go into that folder.

cd VuejsTutorial
Type following command to set up the package.json file.

npm init
Now, give the answers, and after that in your root folder, there is a created file called package.json

the image named "VuejsTutorial" will show you a preview


Now, give the answers, and after that in your root folder, there is a created file called package.json

the image named "tutorial 1" will show you a preview

Then create one index.html file in a root, which will be served by webpack the module bundle.

<!-- index.html -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Vuejs Tutorial With Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>

the image named "index.html" will show you a preview

Step 2: Make webpack.config.js file.
Now, we need to you create one first webpack build. So follow these steps.

Create a file called inwebpack.config.js your root folder.

// webpack.config.js

module.exports = {
  // This is the "main" file which should include all other modules
  entry: './src/main.js',
  // Where should the compiled file go?
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js'
  },
  resolve: {
  alias: {
    vue: 'vue/dist/vue.js'
  }
},
  module: {
    // Special compilation rules
    loaders: [
      {
        // Ask webpack to check: If this file ends with .js, then apply some transforms
        test: /\.js$/,
        // Transform it with babel
        loader: 'babel-loader',
        // don't transform node_modules folder (which don't need to be compiled)
        exclude: /node_modules/
      }
    ]
  }
}

the image named "webpack.config.js" will show you a preview

Create one file called .babelrc in your root folder. 
Babel is the tool used to convert ES6 syntax into present day JavaScript which is ES5.

the image named ".babelrc" will show you a preview

Now install following development dependencies. (the image named "install development dependencies" will show you a preview)

npm install --save-dev babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-stage-3 babel-core babel-loader babel-plugin-transform-runtime babel-runtime webpack webpack-dev-server

Next, we need to install webpack globally in our PC. (the image named "install webpack" will show you a preview) 

npm install -g webpack webpack-dev-server

So now we need to install Vue library via NPM (the image named "install vue library" will show you a preview)

npm install --save vue

Create one folder in root called src. In that create one JavaScript file called main.js

In index.html file put the following code to include our bundle.js file. re edit the index.html file 

<script src="bundle.js"></script>
So your index.html file will look like this.

<!-- index.html -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Vuejs Tutorial With Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app">
      <h3>{{ message }}</h3>
    </div>
    <script src="bundle.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>


Your package.json file will look like this. re edit your package.json file

{
  "name": "vuejstutorial",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "webpack-dev-server"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "babel-core": "^6.25.0",
    "babel-loader": "^7.1.1",
    "babel-plugin-transform-runtime": "^6.23.0",
    "babel-preset-es2015": "^6.24.1",
    "babel-preset-stage-3": "^6.24.1",
    "babel-runtime": "^6.25.0",
    "webpack": "^3.4.1",
    "webpack-dev-server": "^2.6.1"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "vue": "^2.4.2"
  }
}
Here, we have installed webpack-dev-server as a development dependency, so I include webpack-dev-server command in the package.json file. 
So that when you type npm start then, It will start development server. When you change any .js file, then the server will automatically
restart. No need to manually do it.
